# Getting Started

Welcome to True Legacy Homes! This section will help you get set up and ready to work with our AI-powered development tools.

## What You'll Learn

- **Prerequisites** — What software and accounts you need before your first day
- **First Day Setup** — A step-by-step checklist to get everything working
- **Quick Reference** — Key links, contacts, and brand colors all in one place

## How We Work

At True Legacy Homes, we use **Claude Code** (an AI coding assistant) to handle most of the technical heavy lifting. This means:

- You don't need to be a programmer to contribute
- The AI writes code, you review and approve
- Complex tasks become simple conversations

## Before You Begin

Make sure you have:

1. A company GitHub account
2. Access to our Vercel and Supabase projects
3. Claude Code installed on your computer
