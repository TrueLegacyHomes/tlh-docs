# Prerequisites

Before your first day, make sure you have these accounts and tools ready.

## Required Accounts

### 1. GitHub Account

You need a GitHub account to access our code repositories. This is **required before anything else** — we can't invite you to the team until you have one.

**To create your account:**
1. Go to [github.com/signup](https://github.com/signup)
2. Enter your email address (use one you check regularly — work email is fine)
3. Create a password (at least 15 characters, or 8+ with a number and lowercase letter)
4. Choose a username — this can be your name like `transmith` or `john-doe`
5. Complete the puzzle to verify you're human
6. Check your email for a verification code and enter it
7. Skip the personalization questions (click "Skip personalization" at the bottom) — or fill them out if you want

**After signup:**
1. **Reply with the email address you used to sign up** — we need this to send your org invitation
2. Wait for an invitation email from TrueLegacyHomes on GitHub
3. Click "Join TrueLegacyHomes" in the invitation email
4. You're in!

::: tip Already have GitHub?
Just send us your GitHub username or the email associated with your account. We'll send the invite.

3. Install it like any other application

**To verify it worked:**

2. Type `node --version` and press Enter
3. You should see a version number like `v20.10.0`

### 4. Git

Git tracks changes to code. It's usually pre-installed on Mac.

**To check if you have it:**
1. Open Terminal
2. Type `git --version` and press Enter
3. If you see a version number, you're good!

**If you need to install it:**
- Mac: Install Xcode Command Line Tools by typing `xcode-select --install`
- Windows: Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com)

## Optional but Helpful

### Slack

Our team communicates through Slack. Download the app for your phone and computer.
