## Quick Answers

**"Who actually writes the code?"**
Claude (the AI) writes most code. You review, approve, and guide it.

**"Do I need to memorize Git commands?"**
No. Claude handles Git operations. You just need to understand the workflow.

**"What if I mess something up?"**
We have backups and version control. Nothing is permanent. Ask for help.
