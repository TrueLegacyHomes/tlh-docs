## What Makes TLH Different

### AI-First Development

We use Claude (an AI assistant) extensively:
- Claude writes most code
- You guide, review, and approve
- Technical barriers are lower

### Simple Workflows

We optimize for simplicity:
- One Git branch (`main`)
- Automated deployments
- Clear handoffs

### Documentation Culture

We document everything:
- You're reading it right now!
- CLAUDE.md files guide AI behavior
- Processes are written down

## Key Concepts

Before diving into specific guides, understand these fundamentals:

### Environments

|-------------|---------|-----|
| Local | Your computer | localhost:3000 |
| Staging | Team testing | staging.truelegacyhomes.com |
| Production | Live site | truelegacyhomes.com |

### Tools

| Tool | What It Does |
|------|--------------|
| VS Code | Where you write code |
| Claude Code | AI assistant |
| GitHub | Stores code |
| Vercel | Hosts websites |
| Supabase | Database |
| Slack | Team communication |

### Workflow Summary

```
1. You describe what you need
